I'm a third year postgraduate student from [School of MECH](https://mech.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes machine learning and optimization.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yujie Tang](https://tyj518.github.io/) of OPTIMA Lab from [School of Advanced Manufacturing and Robotics](https://amr.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University. 
You can find my CV here: [XX's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
